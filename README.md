# Ad Click Predictor ML Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting ad clicks based on various features. The project utilizes supervised learning techniques to build models that can classify whether a user is likely to click on an ad or not. This README provides an overview of the project structure, its contents, and instructions for usage.

## Contents
1. **Data**: This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
2. **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Scripts**: Python scripts for specific tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
4. **Models**: Saved trained models that can be used for predictions.
5. **Documentation**: Additional documentation related to the project, algorithms used, and model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ad-click-predictor.git
   cd ad-click-predictor
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**:
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Explore Notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open Jupyter notebooks to explore different stages of the project.

5. **Run Scripts**:
   - Explore the `scripts` directory for specific tasks such as data preprocessing (`preprocess.py`), model training (`train.py`), and prediction (`predict.py`).

6. **Train Models**:
   - Use the provided scripts or notebooks to train machine learning models on the provided datasets.

7. **Evaluate Models**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics and techniques discussed in the notebooks.

8. **Prediction**:
   - Use trained models (found in `models` directory) to make predictions on new data. Example scripts or notebooks (`predict.py` or similar) demonstrate this.
